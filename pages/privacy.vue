          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Given that we do not collect any personal data or non-personal data, our practices are straightforward and

            LocalSend is an open-source application, and we are dedicated to user privacy. In line with this, we confirm
            that
            we do not collect, store, process, or use any personal data or non-personal data from you while you use our
            application.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Personal data refers to any information that could potentially identify you as an individual. Non-personal
            data
            refers to any information that does not directly identify you and is aggregated or anonymized. Since we do
            not
            collect any such information, there's no possibility of us using, sharing, or selling this data.

            As LocalSend does not collect any data, there are no concerns regarding the transmission or storage of data.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            While LocalSend itself does not collect any personal or non-personal data, it is important to note that
            users may
            still be subject to data collection by third parties such as operating systems (e.g. Android, iOS), device
            manufacturers, and other apps that have permissions to access device data. We have no control over and
            assume no
            responsibility for the data practices of these third parties. We encourage users to review the privacy
            policies of
            their operating system and device manufacturer to better understand their data practices.
