    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: May 8, 2024</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand our practices regarding any information we might collect
      from you or that you provide to us, the ways in which we use this information, and how we handle it.<br>
      Given that we do not collect any personal data or non-personal data, our practices are straightforward and
      committed
      to safeguarding your privacy.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Personal Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      LocalSend is an open-source application, and we are dedicated to user privacy. In line with this, we confirm that
      we do not collect, store, process, or use any personal data or non-personal data from you while you use our
      application.
      <br>
      Personal data refers to any information that could potentially identify you as an individual. Non-personal data
      refers to any information that does not directly identify you and is aggregated or anonymized. Since we do not
      collect any such information, there's no possibility of us using, sharing, or selling this data.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      As LocalSend does not collect any data, there are no concerns regarding the transmission or storage of data.
      However, we still prioritize the security of our application and the trust you place in us by using it.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Third-Party Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      While LocalSend itself does not collect any personal or non-personal data, it is important to note that users may
      still be subject to data collection by third parties such as operating systems (e.g. Android, iOS), device
      manufacturers, and other apps that have permissions to access device data. We have no control over and assume no
      responsibility for the data practices of these third parties. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of
      their operating system and device manufacturer to better understand their data practices.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any
      changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are
      effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
    </p>
