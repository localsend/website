Hello everyone!
Version 1.16 is finally here!
This release primarily focuses on UX improvements and performance enhancements.
Unfortunately, we had to drop support for Windows 7 to keep up with the latest Flutter updates.

## Changes

- Only accept file requests from favorites.
- Many UX improvements for the macOS Dock and menu bar.
- Multithreading
- Added "Clipboard" button for Android and iOS.
